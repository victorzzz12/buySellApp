* users can filter items by price,
* users can favourite items to check up on them later
* users can send messages to the user that is listing the item

### Admins can:

* post items, which can be seen by others
remove items from the site
* mark items as SOLD!,
* send a message via app, email, or text back on negotiations in buying the said item

## Required Stack:

* ES6 for server-side (NodeJS) code
